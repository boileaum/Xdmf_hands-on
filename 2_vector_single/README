Xdmf Tutorial
=============

Look at the code in gen_data_vector.c 
It builds an hdf5 file containing a 2D vector data defined on a 2D structured rectilinear grid.

Compile it:
source compile.sh

Execute it:
./gen_data_vector

Have a look at the content of the HDF5 files with h5ls and h5dump

The x axis is contained in /X dataset
The y axis is contained in /Y dataset
The x and y components of the vector data are interleaved in the /vector dataset

Build the write_xdmf_xml() routine that produces an xmf file readable by VisIt.
Start by building the grid and visualize the grid in VisIt. Once ok, implement the vector data defined on this grid.
Hints: Build the xmf file by hand at the beginning

In the solution directory you can also see how to handle vector data that are not interleaved in the file gen_data_vector_array.c
