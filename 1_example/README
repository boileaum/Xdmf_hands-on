Xdmf Tutorial
=============

Look at the code in gen_data_grid.c and  gen_data_unstructured.c and try to understand what it does.

Compile it:
source compile.sh

Execute it:
./gen_data_grid
./gen_data_unstructured

It generates .xmf files and .h5 files
Open the xmf files in VisIt and visualize the quantities Pressure, VelocityX and scalar with a pseudocolor plot

You understand everything, now it is your turn ;)
Please look at the README in vector_single directory
