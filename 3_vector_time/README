Xdmf Tutorial
=============

Look at the code in gen_data_vector.c 
It still builds an hdf5 file but containing several 2D vector data defined on a 2D structured rectilinear grid.

Compile it:
source compile.sh

Execute it:
./gen_data_vector

Have a look at the content of the HDF5 files with h5ls and h5dump

The x axis is contained in /X dataset
The y axis is contained in /Y dataset
The x and y components of the vector data are interleaved in each /vector-XX dataset

Build the write_xdmf_xml() routine that produces the set of xmf files that will enable to visualise the data serie with VisIt.
A rather small modification of your vector_single routine will make the trick.
The idea is to generate a serie of xmf files, one per time step with the following naming convention:
xdmfvector-XX.xmf where XX is the time step number
